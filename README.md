# Sublime Text personal settings

As the title says, these are my personal settings for Sublime Text.

## Installation

1. Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
2. In `Packages/User` folder place `Package Control.sublime-settings` so that Sublime Text can install all necessary packages first (you can open console with View → Show Console to see progress). If installation is going slow, system gets unresponsive or some packages don’t get installed, try installing them manually one by one.
3. After installation, move every other settings file to `Packages/User` folder. If you want to have settings files accessible via Git, remove every file and folder in `User` folder and clone this repository.
