# Sublime Text personal settings

As the title says, these are my personal settings for Sublime Text.

## Installation

1. Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
2. In `Packages/User` folder place `Package Control.sublime-settings` so that Sublime Text can install all necessary packages first
3. After installation, move every other settings file to `Packages/User` folder
